# FumetteriaSafara
#### An app by Filippo Defendi

## About the app:
FumetteriaSafara is an app developed free of charge for the comic store Safar√†,
located in Pordenone, Italy.

The application was developed in order to improve my skills with android and
firebase. The app aims to provide access to bonus points gained by either buying
stuff the comic store or winning TCG tournaments. The app also allows access to
stats about the tournaments (according to the sum of tournament points).

Finally the app will allow the user to send a booking request for a comic
series, but this is not a priority right now.

## About the tests:
Unit Tests are temporarly not available due to time constraints/events I am
attending. I am also prioritizing apps which may generate a revenue stream.

## Why didn't i go for TDD in first place:
I have to admit I wanted to start with TDD, but unfortunatly the time constraint
was very tight and the user pool this app was intended for valuated having the
app over having the app bugs-free. I will anyway implement unit tests in the
future since the MIT license allows potential third parts to use this code in its
project.

## Known problems
Currently there's only one known issue... since it's an issue of an older
version (Build Version 14), it will not be solved since it:
a) Afflicted only a single device
b) Should be solved already
In case the issue will pop out again, I'll solve it.

## Constructive critics
Constructive critics are very welcome! No matter if this is a free side-project,
i love to improve the code and learn more, so i'm more than willing to correct
my mistakes!
