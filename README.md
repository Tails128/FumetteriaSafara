# FumetteriaSafara
#### An app by Filippo Defendi

## About the app:
FumetteriaSafara is an app developed free of charge for the comic store Safar√†,
located in Pordenone, Italy.

The application was developed in order to improve my skills with android and
firebase. The app aims to provide access to bonus points gained by either buying
stuff the comic store or winning TCG tournaments. The app also allows access to
stats about the tournaments (winrate).

Finally the app will allow the user to send a booking request for a comic
series, but this is not a priority right now.

## About the code:
The code has been rushed in order to release the app on time for the current
championship season, therefore it is not as much commented and clean as it
should. This won't last for long: the code review is already in progress.
After the management software (which is not on github) for the per-buy bonus is
completed the app's layout will be updated trying to apply the material design
principles to it.

## Known problems
Here's a list of the known problems which will be solved soon
..* overall graphics
..* classic login / classic register 's graphics
..* absence of loading animations (except classic register and facebook's login)

## Constructive critics
Constructive critics are very welcome! No matter if this is a free side-project,
i love to improve the code and learn more, so i'm more than willing to correct
my mistakes!
